OneVersion refers to my (Wesley Mason :: http://1stvamp.org/) freelance trading
name, 1v Software (One Version Software).
This repo is for bits and pieces I collect over time (and over the years if I
delve back into my archive off code) that don't necessarily warrant their own
project repo.


delete_old_emails.php - quick & dirty shell script written in PHP to connect to
an IMAP box and delete any emails older than a set period of days.

DynamicClass - a fun hack class using PHP5.3 features to add "dynamic" methods
onto already defined classes at runtime. Not production useable as it's a big
hack on some language features for something that would need to be part of the
core, and not just using lambdas.

php-check.php - patched version of the "php-check" script to quickly support
PHP5 as well as PHP4.

twnotifier - patched version of the 1.0 branch of twnotifier.py to add on
support for Twitter profile pictures as notification icons.

HTML_QuickForm_Scaffold - work in progress scaffolding scripts for quickly
creating base form HTML views from PEAR HTML_QuickForms, similiar to scaffolding
in RoR / CakePHP etc.
