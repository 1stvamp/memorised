NAME
    twnotifier - Python tools for aggregating your friend's Twitterings

SYNOPSIS
     $>python ~/bin/twitter/twnotifier/twgrowler.py

DESCRIPTION
    Python tools for aggregating your friend's Twitterings.

THE CODE
  twnotifier.py
    A Python script and base class for querying the Twitter API and
    delegating messages. It can be run on its own from the command-line but
    isn't really meant to be.

    It is written in pure-Python but will try to use the ElementTree XML
    libraries if they are present.

  twgrowler.py
    Usage:

     $>python ~/bin/twitter/twnotifier/twgrowler.py

    A command-line tool for sending Twitter messages through the Growl (OS
    X) notification system.

    It has the following dependencies :

    * Growl
        <http://www.growl.info>

    * Growl Python bindings
        <http://growl.info/downloads_developers.php>

    The application will continue running until it is quit by a user,
    polling the Twitter API every 5 minutes.

  twsnarler.py
    Usage:

     $>python C:\\My Documents\twnotifier\twsnarler.py

    A command-line tool for sending Twitter messages through the Snarl
    (Windows) notification system.

    It has the following dependencies :

    * Snarl
        <http://www.fullphat.net/>

    * PySnarl
        <http://code.google.com/p/pysnarl/>

        The application will continue running until it is quit by a user,
        polling the Twitter API every 5 minutes.

  s60_twnotifier.py
    Usage:

     Phone > My own > Python > Options > Run script > s60_twnotifier.py

    A Series 60 Python application for displaying Twitter messages. Due to
    the lack of a built in XML parser and modifications made to Python's
    regular expression engine, it will currently only work on 2nd Edition
    phones.

    It has the following dependencies.

    * PDIS XML Extensions
        <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdis-xpath/>

    If the PDIS Miso extensions are present and the phone is capable the
    application will make the phone virbate when new messages have been
    received. The PDIS Miso extensions can be downloaded from :
    <http://pdis.hiit.fi/pdis/download/miso/>

    The application will continue running until it is quit by a user,
    polling the Twitter API every 5 minutes.

    The application does not yet support text scrolling which can be a
    problem if you get many messages all at once.
